# TwitterBot

Original idea by Ria Galanos, whose documentation and source can be found at
https://github.com/ritagalanos/cs1-twitter


Currently, you will need to create a twitter developer account (developers.twitter.com) and get that application approved.  
All of the credentials you recieve should be added to a twitter4j.properties file.  This file in this repository is blank.

This program will search twitter posts in a geolocated area for a specific search term, or, pull a specific user's tweets and display them.
